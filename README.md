# Welcome to DevRadar!

Hi, it's my project created for RocketSeat Omnistack 10, using Google maps API and geolocation to search some developers using the same technology as you!
In the root path, as you can see, there are three folders:

 - backend
 - frontend
 - mobile

The backend folder, has a RestAPI, frontend is created with ReactJS and mobile with React Native.

# First

You must have an Atlas MongoDB account, you must also change the access code within backend/src/index.js, mongoose.connect().
